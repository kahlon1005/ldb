* WL0-157 (BUG) - Items shorted using Inventory Unavailable pick short reason code while doing Pick by Container does not get picked up by Pick by Order. Formerly created from Pick by Container testing and recorded and tested using ALM-2745 by Ekta. 
* WL0-21 - Container Number is not generated when the User Picks the item after Cycle Count Inventory Update. Tested using ALM-2914
* This ticket confirms the requirements for final SIT and UAT, and deployment_

*Business Problem:*
Items shorted using the Inventory Unavailable pick short reason code while doing Pick by Container do not get picked up by Pick by Order. An SP* container # for picking the remaining quantity using Pick by Order is not created.

This causes several business problems, including:
* The order is shorted for the customer if not caught
* The unpicked quantity can result in the inability to complete the shipment and generate documents
* When the container # is missing, Inventory needs to manually create a new container #, print a new label and send a Assembler out to Pick by Order

The Business Sponsor is John Sweet

*Business Requirements:*
When an item(s) is shorted in Pick By Container using the reason Inventory Unavailable, a Cycle Count needs to be displayed where the Assembler can enter the actual quantity at the location (typically 0), and a new PICK command needs to be created for the remaining with an assigned SP* To Container number. If required (based on the inventory available and allocations), a REPL command also needs to be created. Once the location is replenished, the remaining quantity then needs to be available for Pick by Order.

*Business Rationale:*
This change will not require a process flow change for the Assembler. It will reduce effort in the Wave Planning / Inventory office who currently need to resolve the issues caused by these short picks and missing container #'s.
The issue is severe and high priority, is occurring every day, and is impacting the Wave Planners and Inventory, and Shipping Office Teams

*Solution (TECSYS Patches):*
TECSYS has provided two patches which require SIT, including extensive regression testing to confirm the Pick by Container and Order functionality is not impacted. UAT will follow:
* RFI 20697 - When a command is short picked with reason code Inventory Unavailable and inventory is found in a replenishment location, a pick for the remainder is to be created if the Fill Shortages Flag is set to No on the Outbound Order
* RFI 21067 - When a user picks short with reason 'Inventory Unavailable' while having the Close Container flag set to 'Yes' and then during the resulting cycle count specifies a positive quantity in the picking .. ?

*Steps to Reproduce:*
Please refer to the test scripts recorded in ALM-2745 and ALM-2914",,david.robbins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DDCFUN-496,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,S002,,,,,, ,{},,,,,,, ,,,, ,, ,,,,, ,,,,,,,1|i00e8f:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a regular basis WMS is creating Queued PICK commands with missing or blank Container ID's. These items cannot be picked, and are one of the sources of customer orders being shorted. Also, shipping documents cannot be generated until these open commands are cancelled - which requires Inventory to short the order with the reason INVENTORY NOT REQUIRED.
There are likely several source causes for this issue - one of them being worked through a TECSYS patch is S002 (DDCFUN-37).
The first step which is currently underway is to examine in detail each of of the Commands being created daily, looking at the order history, inventory availability, replenishment, user transactions, etc. to document the history of the transaction, observations, and comments on probable causes if they can be determined.

The C* or SP* container id should never be nulled or blanked out on an existing Queued Pick Command. In particular, if the user uses More Actions in Pick by Container and selects Skip, the queued command is to be displayed at the completion of the other container picks and not ""orphaned"" with a blank To Container Id.
Additional business requirements related to the blanking of the container id can be found in [DDCFUN-37]

The approach to diagnose Pick by Container's missing SP containers on Picks, and the person responsible:
1.	Follow Picker to see what they did to cause no SP e.g. logout, lost wireless connection etc. (Dave)
2.	Monitor Queued Commands, and when see missing SP container, find picker and ask if they did anything different or anything different happened on the system (Dave)
3.	QA – try to duplicate (including negative testing) the picking to cause missing containers (Ales to talk to Bob and support QA team)
4.	SQL analysis of transactions of a known missing container (Ales talk to Bikram or SAs)

Note: the cycle count on an Inventory Unavailable pick is known to cause the missing SP container on the pick, but isn’t the cause of all of the missing containers.
","04/Jun/19 11:34 AM;david.robbins;*_Order 1167627_*
Hi Ales and Sandeep
I just talked directly with an assembler regarding another incident where TECSYS created an orphaned PICK with no container id. Here is what happened:
Order 1167627 / item 563981 / location 29-319-11 / user brikenne / Container C1220658
1.	Picked 1 case from 29-309-11 – this was the second last pick for the container (based on command sequence)
2.	Tecsys did not display a pick for the last pick for 1 case at 23-319-11 – instead Tecsys displayed a message in yellow text – she didn’t recall the exact wording – but it was something like “there is nothing further to pick ..”. The user was “thrown out of the order” [I suspect at this point Tecsys “orphaned” the pick and removed the container id from the PICK command]
3.	The user tried Pick by Container twice more, scanned the CPRE .. but there were no picks displayed [because the remaining pick was “orphaned”
4.	The user then used “Container Pick Complete” to drop off the container at the Wrapper
I have checked the following to confirm there were no other factors that could have influenced this behavior:
1.	Replenishment is not an issue - there is inventory at 23-319-11, and there are no other orders allocated to the item
2.	I did not ask the user if she lost wireless or the system “froze on her” – but from her description, Tecsys could not complete the container picks properly and displayed the message
3.	She stated the message displays more frequently in the Bottle Tower (which confirms my observations – there are proportionally more orphaned picks occurring in the tower today)
I will continue to work with operations to record more incidents 
","11/Jun/19 11:44 AM;david.robbins;Based on testing done in INT1 on June 7 by QA, it appears a source cause of the issue is as follows - if the Assembler skips a pick using more actions when using Pick by Container, the pick is to be re-displayed for the Assembler before the container is closed - however, instead, the skipped pick command(s) is not being re-displayed. Instead, the To Container field on the command is blanked / nulled.
This was subsequently tested in INT3 by QA, and apparently the issue did not occur in that environment - perhaps the TECSYS patch has resolved the issue
The next step is to discuss the INT3 test results, confirm the details of the patches, confirm a further patch is not needed, and retest in UAT (for the patches)","13/Jun/19 4:23 PM;david.robbins;Reset the status to BLOCKED - this issues requirements monitoring to discover the source cause(s) of this issue, frequency, etc. before we can determine whether a change is required","26/Jun/19 9:50 AM;jason.kelly;Hi [~david.robbins]

* [WL0-157|https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/browse/WL0-157] (BUG) - Items shorted using Inventory Unavailable pick short reason code while doing Pick by Container does not get picked up by Pick by Order. Formerly created from Pick by Container testing and recorded and tested using ALM‌-2745 by Ekta.
* [WL0-21|https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/browse/WL0-21] - Container Number is not generated when the User Picks the item after Cycle Count Inventory Update. Tested using ALM‌-2914

This ticket confirms the requirements for final SIT and UAT, and deployment_

*Business Problem:*
Items shorted using the Inventory Unavailable pick short reason code while doing Pick by Container do not get picked up by Pick by Order. An SP* container # for picking the remaining quantity using Pick by Order is not created.

This causes several business problems, including:

* The order is shorted for the customer if not caught
* The unpicked quantity can result in the inability to complete the shipment and generate documents
* When the container # is missing, Inventory needs to manually create a new container #, print a new label and send a Assembler out to Pick by Order

The Business Sponsor is John Sweet

*Business Requirements:*
When an item(s) is shorted in Pick By Container using the reason Inventory Unavailable, a Cycle Count needs to be displayed where the Assembler can enter the actual quantity at the location (typically 0), and a new PICK command needs to be created for the remaining with an assigned SP* To Container number. If required (based on the inventory available and allocations), a REPL command also needs to be created. Once the location is replenished, the remaining quantity then needs to be available for Pick by Order.

*Business Rationale:*
This change will not require a process flow change for the Assembler. It will reduce effort in the Wave Planning / Inventory office who currently need to resolve the issues caused by these short picks and missing container #'s.
The issue is severe and high priority, is occurring every day, and is impacting the Wave Planners and Inventory, and Shipping Office Teams

*Solution (TECSYS Patches):*
TECSYS has provided two patches which require SIT, including extensive regression testing to confirm the Pick by Container and Order functionality is not impacted. UAT will follow:

RFI 20697 - When a command is short picked with reason code Inventory Unavailable and inventory is found in a replenishment location, a pick for the remainder is to be created if the Fill Shortages Flag is set to No on the Outbound Order

RFI 21067 - When a user picks short with reason 'Inventory Unavailable' while having the Close Container flag set to 'Yes' and then during the resulting cycle count specifies a positive quantity in the picking .. ?

*Steps to Reproduce:*
When using Pick by Container, items shorted using the Inventory Unavailable pick short reason code do not get picked by “Pick by Order”. A short pick (SP* container) Pick command is either not being generated for the quantity not picked by Pick by Container, or is generated with a missing SP* Container id.

*Suggested Test Scenarios and Expected Results:*

_Note - it is recommended that a complete end to end test of Pick by Container and Pick by Order functionality be completed using the original test scripts to confirm these patches have not impacted other areas of the solution. The following describes the specific tests for the current problem_

Items shorted using Inventory Unavailable pick short reason code get picked by “Pick by Order” after the location is replenished. Testing should be performed for both a Case pick container, and a Bottle Pick Tower container.

# Confirm the current inventory quantity at the FP location for the order item (greater than the order item quantity), and there is inventory in a reserve FIFO location
# Use Pick by Container for the item, and short pick the item (input quantity < order item quantity) with a Pick Short Reason = Inventory Unavailable
# Set the inventory at the location to 0 using the Cycle Count Command that is triggered after the short pick
# Confirm a Replenishment Command is automatically generated to replenish the location. It should be in Ready status (assuming there are no additional REPL commands for the location)
# Confirm a Pick command with an SP* container id is automatically generated with a quantity = remaining quantity for the order item. The Pick command should be in PAUR status waiting for the Replenishment
# Complete the Replenishment. The Pick command should now be in Ready status
# Use Pick by Order to pick the remaining quantity for the order item into a new C* container, and close the container
# Confirm there are no remaining pick commands for the order

"Outbound summary report - Shorts in pick by order not clearing from report, and ""Orphaned"" picks without a To Container Id are not reported (S003)",DDCFUN-16,12068,Story,Completed,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,High,Done,david.robbins,david.robbins,david.robbins,29/Apr/19 11:53 AM,03/Jul/19 3:57 PM,26/Sep/19 3:41 PM,03/Jul/19 3:57 PM,,0,,,"*Business Problem*
When Inventory decides to Short Pick the remaining items on an Outbound Order, they use the Pick by Order command, and short-pick each of the remaining order items with a reason code of INVENTORY NOT REQUIRED. This command deletes the open PICK commands (typically for an SP* container) for the order, and updates the Order Details, setting the Scheduled Quantity to 0, and the Unfilled Quantity to the quantity that is shorted. 
However, these details are currently not removed from the Outbound Order Summary report. Since this report is used to track the remaining picking activities for an order, it appears there is more picking to be completed for the order where in fact there isn't. 
An example from PRD is displayed below. The 6 cases in the first row were shorted by Inventory, and there are no outstanding PICK commands. The order is ready for shipping.
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

As a second problem, in certain circumstances the To Container ID can be removed from a PICK command. The primary source cause occurs when an Assembler using Pick by Container prematurely or accidentally closes the Pick by Container work flow without completing a specific actin for each PICK task. The commands that are not completed are ""orphaned"", and the To Container field is nulled. A fix for this priority issue is being addressed by ticket DDCFUN-37.

Currently these ""orphaned"" pick quantities are excluded from the Outbound Order Summary report. Because this wave planners and shippers have no visibility on outstanding picks, and the orders are regularly being shorted.

*Business Requirements:*
The Outbound Order Summary view is not to report a line for an order that has been wave planned and when there are no Queued Commands remaining for the order. In addition, the total Cases Orders and Bottles Orders Totals are to exclude the quantity that was not picked. In Order Details, short picked items have a plan quantity and unfilled quantity, but no scheduled quantity. They can have a completed quantity if the item was partially picked. Using the example from PRD, the required views is as follows:
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

In addition, the Outbound Order Summary view is to report a line without a container id which totals the order quantity to be picked when there are pending Queued Commands that have a blank To Container field. The line is to report a Yes for Pending Commands with a link to a view of the pending commands with the blank To Container id. An example follows - when the user hovers their mouse over the Yes in the first line, the pop-up sub-view will open listing the pending commands with a missing container id.:
 !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! 

*Business Impact:*
This change will impact Wave Planners, Inventory, and Shipping users in the office who are tracking the remaining picks for an order, and determining whether the order is ready for shipment. The issue has been ranked as a medium priority - as a workaround today users are ignoring the extra line on the report when Pending Commands = No. The issue is occurring on a daily basis, for example, on May 6, Inventory shorted about 20 orders.
Since this is a change to an existing view, the issue should not be complex to resolved (subject to SA review)

*Steps to Reproduce:*
Partially complete the picking for an Order using Pick by Container. Then short pick the remaining order items and quantities using the reason code INVENTORY NOT REQUIRED. The LDB Outbound Summary Report will list the order quantities that were shorted on line 1 without a container id. The Order Details records for the shorted items will have the Unfilled Qty = Shorted Qty, and the Scheduled Qty = 0. All Queued PICK commands for the order will be completed.

The same results likely occur if order is shorted in Pick by Container with the reason code INVENTORY NOT REQUIRED (not tested).

*Suggested Test Scenarios:*
# Partially complete the picking for an Order using Pick by Container. Then short pick the remaining order items and quantities using the reason code INVENTORY NOT REQUIRED. The LDB Outbound Summary Report will NOT list the order quantities that were shorted on line 1 without a container id.
# The same results should occur if order is shorted in Pick by Container with the reason code INVENTORY NOT REQUIRED.
# In Pick by Container, short an item using the reason code INVENTORY UNAVAILABLE. The remaining order quantity is to remain on LDB Outbound Summary.
# In Pick by Order, short an item using the reason code INVENTORY UNAVAILABLE. The remaining order quantity is to not be reported on LDB Outbound Summary.
# In pick by Order, items that are short picked using the reason code CONTAINER FULL or PARTIAL PICKED will remain on the report
# Using Pick by Container, prematurely close the workflow without completing all PICK commands. The ""orphaned"" queued commands will remain without a To Container ID. The Outbound Order Summary will included a line without a Container ID that totals the orphaned picked amounts. The user will be able to view the commands by hovering over Pending Commands = Yes.",,bikram.kahlon,bob.kang,david.robbins,ekta.dwivedi,jason.kelly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26/Jun/19 2:41 PM;david.robbins;DDC-16 - Outbound Order Summary - Shorts not Clearing - User Acceptance Testing (726b0bb3-3fdd-4e47-865b-3f767f27ce15).docx;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10630/DDC-16+-+Outbound+Order+Summary+-+Shorts+not+Clearing+-+User+Acceptance+Testing+%28726b0bb3-3fdd-4e47-865b-3f767f27ce15%29.docx,29/May/19 4:08 PM;ekta.dwivedi;JIRA ticket DDCFUN 16 and 66.xlsx;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10483/JIRA+ticket+DDCFUN+16+and+66.xlsx,06/May/19 4:00 PM;david.robbins;screenshot-1.png;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10369/screenshot-1.png,06/May/19 4:50 PM;david.robbins;screenshot-2.png;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10374/screenshot-2.png,19/Jun/19 3:55 PM;david.robbins;screenshot-3.png;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10594/screenshot-3.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,david.robbins,,S003,,,,,, ,{},,,DDCFUN-505,,,, ,,TST-452818,, ,, ,,,,CHG-451296, ,,RLS-452814,,,,ekta.dwivedi,1|i00bf3:,,,,,bikram.kahlon,,,,,,,,,,DDC Stabilization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-05-06 21:10:18.678,06/May/19 2:10 PM;bikram.kahlon;[~david.robbins] can you provide requirements to [~jason.chen].

The Container Pick Close workflow screen contains an unnecessary weight field - too much information clutters up the mobile device screen

Also, when dropping off a container at a final Destination Location (typically the shipping staging lane) that differs from the one planned by the Wave Planner for the Order, the Stager is prompted with 3 additional questions that are not requested if the final destination is not changed. The requirement is to allow the picker and stager to be able to sign a container into the wrapper or the staging lane with as little information as possible. On the hand-held, answering questions is time consuming.

Wave Planners and Shippers do not have the ability to track whether the pallet containers for an order have been staged to either the Destination Location planned for the order, or to a final location set by the Stager

*Business Requirements:*
The Wave Planner sets the Destination Location for the containers to be picked, wrapped, and staged for each Order. The Destination Location is intended to represent the location where pallets are to be staged to after wrapping and before loading. For example SHIP-9B.
Tecsys will automatically record a Yes on a PICK command when each Container is moved to the Order’s Destination Location by the Stager.
The Stager can also confirm drop-off at an alternate location based on instructions from the Wave Planner – for this scenario, they indicate the Final Destination = Yes when completing the move.
For both of these scenarios, the Outbound Order Summary is to now report Yes in a New Column called Final Location for the container. Otherwise, a No is to be reported.

1. The Final location field in Outbound order Summary is not fetching its Value from Container Pick Close-> Final Location flag. 
If you set the Final Location to NO for SHIP0, it still shows the FINAL LOCATION  as YES in  Outbound Order Summary.

2. The Final Location in Outbound Summary changes to 
                               * Yes* when the Container is in SHIP0 location.
                           *     No* when it is in CNSLDTN location.
                               *Yes* when the Pallet is in QA Location.

The above changes are reflected in Outbound order Summary depending on your action  on Container Pick Close screen after the Picking is complete.

Discussion around what is the best way to increase the efficiency of the replenishments while prioritizing for waves that have been released, so far we have these details pending review from the business.



Replenishment by  Section screen:

 

The first column to the left should have the wave number.


The screen should always group the waves starting with the one that was released first.


The business needs to create a group of sections that will be used to assign the replenishment tasks to the replenishment drivers.


Some of the inputs to take into consideration for the definition of the new sections are:

Velocity of the items


Average of the duration of a replenishment and the average of replenishments performed on any given day on the different aisles which could be the rationale for the creation of the new sections.



The areas relationship to sections can be of one/one or one/many.


Once the sections have been created the warehouse searches have to be updated accordingly.

Hi Chaminda / Ludwig,



We would always want to go to the generic description and after sharing screens with Chaminda I only was able to view one SKU but it looked like the bottle UOM has the description we would like. With that being said I was only able to view one SKU.



This SNIP is from product profile on the home page and we currently use this to get the SCC needed to print labels and it has all the descriptions here as well.

John indicated that the work is +low priority+. He doesn’t want to go ahead with turning on the scales at Wrapper 1 and 2 because:

1. He believes the wrappers will not work properly as they are meant for a manufacturing facility with uniform, single SKU pallets, and the automatically-printed and –attached label will not consistently stick to the pallet

2. The shipping label is placed in a place too low on the pallet, which makes it difficult to find on the shipping dock with many pallets together

3. Additional costs (the $35K) to get the wrapper scales QA working are not justified at this point, especially since we can’t know whether the wrappers will work properly after the expenditure

# Install a wireless gun (same as on Wrapper-3/4) on the lead to the wrapper
# Change the process such that when the loader loads the pallet to the wrapper they use the new gun to change location of the container.

Just to update you all on a the Automated/Semi-Automated Wrappers. I was asked to get them working again so that if desired they could be turned on.  During the week Marco(GF) and I tried to test the new scanners/printing solution however we discovered that the mini-computer that connects the wrappers to TecSys was non-functional. A Quick check revealed that it was the same with Wrapper 1, 3, and 4.
We removed on of the computers and  hooked it up to a monitor etc.. to see if the machines was booting. We were unable to get any response from the unit.

GF (Marco) called John Crummy out from 3 Phase Power to check on these units (units were provided by 3 Phase under contract to GF). John came on site this afternoon and tried himself to get a response from the unit. After been unable to get a response John removed the unit and has taken back to his base for further investigation.

At this point I am waiting on John's diagnosis of the problem but I just wanted to check in and let everyone know what is going on.

Also would someone be able to provide me with the warranty terms? I would like to understand where we stand if  these units have failed and require replacement.
Thanks

Marco,

I'm CC'ing Brett on this as well, as he was asking about this earlier.

He is what I send Brett: They are being replaced on warranty, but we need to send them back first (which we have already done). I'm hoping to have the new ones back next week, then I just need to reinstall the RAM and hard drives, and they should be good to know. Once I get confirmation that they are being shipped to us, I can let you know.

I might know more on Monday, as the ones we shipped are still on their way (but they did make it through the border).

Marco, I did pull one of them on Friday to check it out, and the PC appears to be dead and won't power up. I pulled the other three this morning. Intel is looking into it, but it is looking to me that they need to be replaced (they are still in warranty). Hopefully I should hear back from them later today and can give an ETA on when that can happen.

John I pull the intel box out of wrapper-1 (has same issue as al others) and hooked it up to the power supply for the unit (found in a bag on the wrapper) and hooked it to a monitor at my desk.

I get the orange light on the power button but there is nothing else happening nothing shows on the monitor

Hi John - We tried to do some testing with the new scanners in the automatic wrappers today and we had issues with the 3Phase controller not communicating and sending requests to the Techsys system.  We believe the Pc is not responding as the Ethernet port switch lights are not on.

The printer and communication to Techsys has been disabled on the wrapper side for quite some time so I don't know if that had something to do with the issue.  Wrapper 2 also has an error light flashing on the Prosoft unit.

Would you be able to stop by and help us with this?  Let me know your availability. Thanks

The computers have been sitting in the same town since Monday, so they haven't got to Intel yet, which means I don't have the new ones coming my way yet. Now it is showing they won't be delivered until Friday. I will let you know when that happens.

I did get the new computers in. I've gone through the first one, and it is taking me longer than I thought it would. I need to run updates on them to get new drives in for the Ethernet port. For the most part I can just leave it sitting there, but it will probably take all of tomorrow to do this. I think I can install these on Thursday, if that works for you.

5. Consolidate the picking of outbound orders from e-Biz for the same customer ship-to and shipping period
·         Requirement: Consolidate picking commands for outbound orders received from e-Biz for the same customer ship to and ship date / period to enable the ability to pick items on the order(s) only once. Retain the concept of picking and packing by outbound order number (required by e-Biz for customer order status tracking and invoicing). Solution: Potential solutions need more investigation. This includes an evaluation of how Radio Beacon may be handling this requirement. This will likely need a (potentially complex) change to the wave planning / release process to provide the ability to pick multiple CPRE’s for multiple orders for the same item at the same time.

Good afternoon everyone,

Thank you Lauren, correct, I had a conversation with Hector this morning we are going to setup a meeting on this topic. Here is my proposed next steps for this item….escalate with our team, the information that I’ve looked at today, out of 2000 transactions the most that I can pull out of the logged transactions, there are 125 duplicates, that would show quite a substantial amount of items that would result in multiple pick commands in the system on a given day.

1) Emily / Sri to complete and verify the dataset below, and identify the root cause, is it Oracle itself, the interface, or another technical reason for the behavior

2) Once Emily / Sri has completed, ideally we can verify the issue quickly, and setup a meeting with Hector / Lily to escalate

3) We’ll create a focus group to tackle the issue and identify possible solutions as quickly as possible

4) Continue with the regular business processes to enact the change based on the solution recommendations

*@Dave*, is there anything additional that you can add to this thread for reference?

*@Emily*, please see below two examples as a reference, there are many more if you need additional information in the excel sheet.

Bottle Pick Tower - UOM for picking Case Quantities in Bottle Pick Tower (S014),DDCFUN-19,11684,Story,Ready for UAT,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,High,,craig.kelly,david.robbins,david.robbins,25/Feb/19 11:07 AM,20/Aug/19 10:56 AM,12/Aug/19 10:05 AM,,,0,,,"*Business Problem:*

When an order item is released to bottle pick tower for picking, when the pick quantity = case quantity, the input quantity and unit of measure (UOM) are displayed based on the case UOM for the picker (e.g. Pick 1 CASE12) into a BX12. See example in the attached file

Pickers in the Bottle Tower expect to see the quantity based on the BTL UOM (e.g. Pick 12 BTL). When the pick quantity is displayed as 1 with an Input UOM of CASE12, the picker can accidently assume they need to pick 1 bottle versus 12 bottles.

John Sweet is the requester and management sponsor for this ticket.

_NOTE - _Alvaro (TECSYS) was consulted regarding this ticket. The initial request was to always display the UOM as BTL in the bottle pick tower, even when the quantity was cases. TECSYS stated that changing the pick quantity displayed based on location was a ""core"" change to TECSYS and not recommended. TECSYS recommended that instead an alert message in red font be triggered based on an expression and displayed for the Picker.

_NOTE - The ticket DDCFUN-25 which defines the requirement to display the pick quantity for the Assembler in cases instead of 1 pallet for a full pallet. These two require a consistent solution for both pallet quantity picks as well as case quantity picks in the bottle tower.

*Business Requirement:*

When:
# A container pick command is assigned a location within the bottle pick tower area, and
# The container pick quantity equals a multiple of the Quantity of UOM 1 in UOM 2 for the item to be picked

then display the pick quantity and UOM in BTL's instead of cases.

This change is to be made to all mobile device screens the pick quantity and UOM is displayed. In particular this includes Confirm and Complete Pick Command (Pick by Container) as well as other mobile screens used by Pick by Cluster and Pick by Order (if applicable)

*Options Considered and Proposed Solution:*
Option 1 (Recommended) - Always display the pick quantity in BTL's in the bottle pick tower, even when the quantity is for 1 case

Option 2 - Display an alert message in red font to alert the Assembler in the Bottle Pick Tower that the pick UOM is in cases not BTL. This option has been rejected by the business - the reason the message would be displayed in frequently and they would miss it.

Option 3: Change core TECSYS to only display input quantities and BTL UOM's when in the bottle tower - core changes are not recommended by TECSYS

This workflow logic is only to be applied for pick commands in the Bottle Pick Tower. Proposed solution from Alvaro: "" this logic will be based on the Area (sa_f) to determine if the location is in a bottle pick area or a case pick area. Individual areas won’t be hard coded into the logic – instead, I would use the ‘LDB WMS System Properties’ table and refer to the Areas included within the custom property  ‘BOTTLE_PICK_AREA’.

*Functional Requirements:*

Option 1 is to be implemented. The specific requirements follow:
For Pick by Container using an example of an item with UOM2 = CASE12, the changes would be to:
•	Change the display of Pick 1 CASE12 to Pick 12 BTL
•	Change the input quantity that is automatically displayed from 1.000 to 12.000
•	Enable the user to record 12.000 as the quantity picked, and record this as the quantity processed in TECSYS
For Pick by Order example (this screen should be changing to the Pick by Container screen):
•	Display 12.000 in the left hand field and BTL in the right hand field
•	Enable the user to record 12.000 as the quantity picked, and record this as the quantity processed in TECSYS

Screenshots of the required screen layouts for Pick by Container and Pick by Order follow:
   !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

*Business Rationale:*

When the issue occurs (a picker accidentally enters 1 as the input quantity for the pick and continues) there is no current ""back"" ability for the Picker to return to the screen and record the correct input quantity. If the picker catches the issue, they likely would need to contact the wave planner to request another container / CPRE. 

*Proposed Test Scenario(s)*
Create a case quantity order for an item with UOM2 = CASE12 for which the only inventory is in the Bottle Tower (Case FP is empty as well as Reserves). The pick command will be assigned to the Bottle Pick area. The Pick by Container and Pick by Order screens are expected to display the pick quantity and UOM as 12 BTL, not 1 CASE12",,ales.eisner,david.robbins,ekta.dwivedi,jason.chen,lauren.mackenzie,,,,,,,,,,,,,WL0-201,DDCFUN-849,DFR-218,12/Jul/19 4:31 PM;david.robbins;DDC-19 25 and 58 - Mobile Device Screen Improvements - UAT Test Scripts.docx;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10701/DDC-19+25+and+58+-+Mobile+Device+Screen+Improvements+-+UAT+Test+Scripts.docx,10/Jul/19 2:11 PM;ekta.dwivedi;Handheld Pick By Order.PNG;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10683/Handheld+Pick+By+Order.PNG,10/Jul/19 2:11 PM;ekta.dwivedi;Handheld Pick By Order2.PNG;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10682/Handheld+Pick+By+Order2.PNG,11/Jul/19 2:41 PM;ekta.dwivedi;Queued Command for UOM verification.PNG;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10689/Queued+Command+for+UOM+verification.PNG,11/Jul/19 2:41 PM;ekta.dwivedi;UOM conversion on handheld.jpeg;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10688/UOM+conversion+on+handheld.jpeg,28/Mar/19 3:16 PM;david.robbins;WL0-133 and WL0-39 - Changes to the Confirm and Complete Pick Command Screen.pptx;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10310/WL0-133+and+WL0-39+-+Changes+to+the+Confirm+and+Complete+Pick+Command+Screen.pptx,10/Jul/19 2:11 PM;ekta.dwivedi;handheld Pick by Container Screenshot 1.PNG;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10684/handheld+Pick+by+Container+Screenshot+1.PNG,07/Jun/19 4:10 PM;david.robbins;screenshot-1.png;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10528/screenshot-1.png,07/Jun/19 4:11 PM;david.robbins;screenshot-2.png;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10529/screenshot-2.png,,,,,,,,,,,,craig.kelly,,S014,,,,,, ,{},,,WL0-9,,,, ,, ,, ,, ,,,,, ,, 458280,,,,ekta.dwivedi,1|i00bfr:,,,,,jason.chen,,,,,,,,,,DDC Stabilization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-05-16 17:49:04.135,"15/May/19 11:24 AM;david.robbins;[~brad.rykenhuizen] This one is ready for your assessment and technical design.

The former is rejected by the team, for these reasons:
- The rule updates the pick command in the Queued Commands table (cm_f) of the database.  We don't know for sure if the update will cause any problem.
- The cm_f table is a busy table, and the rule is triggered by every create and update, and may cause a performance problem.

The team supports the Javascript approach.  This approach is already in the receiving process.  The JS code runs in a web browser (workstation or RF gun), and changes the input Qty and input UOM in the UI.  The changes are then submitted to WMS and overwrites the fields in the system/database.

The JS solution requires fields Area and Input UOM be added to the pick screens, and Input UOM must be an input field.  These screen changes require business approval.

"Bottle Pick Tower - Increase the Maximum Weight Capacity for Bottle Pick Tower Container Types (BX12, BX06, BX2L) (S014)",DDCFUN-18,11701,Story,Completed,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,High,Done,david.robbins,david.robbins,david.robbins,27/Feb/19 2:15 PM,14/Jun/19 2:39 PM,26/Sep/19 3:41 PM,14/Jun/19 2:39 PM,,0,,,"*Business Problem:*

A high frequency of pick commands in the bottle tower are for less than container volume capacity e.g. pick 11 bottles in a BX12.

Based on the analysis of PRD pick commands and transactions by wave, order, container, and item for the Bottle Pick Tower, there are many cases where the container is “weighing out” at the 16 Kg limit with less than 12 bottles, and a single “orphan” container is created for the remaining bottles. There is an opportunity to increase the capacity to 17KG or 18KG to increase the probability of full cases being picked.

This increase was confirmed by DDC Operations (Ken, John and Doug) in terms of workplace safety and health. 

The requesters are John Sweet and Len Tong. John is the management sponsor.

*Business Requirement:*

Set the Maximum Weight Capacity and Empty Container Weight for Container Types:
BX12 - to 18.6 KG / 0.70 KG
BX06 - to 18.6 KG / 0.62 KG
BX2L - to 18.6 KG / 0.42 KG

This change is not to result in any picks of more than 12 bottles in a BX12, 6 in a BX06 and 2 in a BX2L (based on the volume dimensions of the item).

*Business Rationale:*

This change will impact all Assembly pickers in the bottle Pick Tower or in the consolidation area. Their procedures will not change, but the weight of some of the bottle pick containers could increase by 1 or 2 KG.

The issue is of high priority since picking containers that are less than full requires additional effort (picking into multiple containers, container assembly, consolidation of more containers). 

The issue is frequent and is occurring for the majority of orders picked in the bottle tower.

*Proposed Solution*
Resolution is simple - Make a change to the configuration data for the container types.

*Replication of the Issue*
* Create / select a bottle pick quantity order or 12 bottles with multiple items. Select items and quantity that weigh > 16 KG using the item weight from the item master
* Wave plan and release the order
* Two container pick commands will be created - one for 10 or 11 bottles (with weight total < 16KG), and one for 1 or 2 bottles for the remainder

*Suggested Test Scenarios*
* Confirm an order for 12 bottles weighing more than 16 KG is containerized into one BX12
* Confirm an order for 12 bottles weighing more than 17.9 KG is containerized into 2 BX12
* Repeat for BX06
* Repeat for BX2L",,brad.rykenhuizen,david.robbins,jason.chen,jason.kelly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,david.robbins,,S014,,,,,, ,{},,,WL0-9,,,, ,, ,, ,, ,,,,, ,, ,,,,hubert.xu,1|i00bfj:,,,,,brad.rykenhuizen,,,,,,,,,,DDC Stabilization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-05-03 17:11:12.105,"03/May/19 10:11 AM;brad.rykenhuizen;need to create sub tasks [~brad.rykenhuizen]

However, this ticket will be resolved once the carriers-carrier service associations are updated (JIRA DDCFUN‌-65 (S035)).  Because each carrier has a unique name per freight lane, even if it’s the same carrier (i.e. Van Kam 1 services VNIS CR, Van Kam 2 services VNIS MD), the document is printing the trailer manifest for the first customer.

Add Unfilled Lines Count and Update Sub-View for LDB Wave Management (S021),DDCFUN-84,11641,Story,Completed,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,High,Done,bikram.kahlon,ales.eisner,ales.eisner,07/Feb/19 2:18 PM,16/Jul/19 10:06 AM,26/Sep/19 3:41 PM,16/Jul/19 10:06 AM,,0,,,"*Business Problem:*
The LDB Wave Management view results currently include columns for the total count of planned order lines for the wave, a count of filled order lines, and a column for Unfilled Lines which simply presents the text +Go. The Unfilled Lines field is hyperlinked, but when the user hovers over the field the user is presented with the message ""There were no results to display"". The reason for the no results is the sub-view Dispatcher - Unfilled Lines (wms_od_f.dispatcher_unfilled_lines) is defaulted to display order lines with the status BACK or BRSL - LDB is not using the backorder functionality, so nothing is displayed in the view.
* Unfilled Lines = Count of Order Lines planned for the Wave which have an Unfilled Quantity > 0
* Unfilled Quantity for an Order Line = Planned Quantity - Scheduled Quantity - Completed Quantity (counted in UOM1 for each item)
* Scheduled Quantity for an Order Line = The quantity of inventory currently scheduled to be picked for the line item (in UOM1). This equates to the total Queued Command Quantity for the order and item. The quantity is reduced  as commands are completed
* Completed Quantity for an Order Line = The quantity that has been picked for the Order and Item

The LDB Wave Management Details screen includes a section for each Order in the Wave - however, there is no information provided on which order(s) have an unfilled line(s). Sections are also displayed for each Order, listing the Order Lines. An Unfilled Quantity is reported for Order Line.

The primary use of the Unfilled Lines and Quantity fields is for the Wave Planner executing wave planning and release to quickly investigate order lines that are not successfully planned (are unfilled, with no inventory allocated for the order item and not pick commands scheduled). The Wave Planner needs to resolve all of the Unfilled Lines before completing Wave Release - by, for example reducing the Plan Quantity to match inventory availability, or prioritizing put away.

When using the LDB Wave Management search results and detailed screen, the Wave Planner currently has trouble identifying the orders that have unfilled lines and the count of unfilled lines using the LDB Wave Management screen, and has to mouse-over every single line.  Also, the sub-view that lists the unfilled order line details is currently not working (it always displays ""There are no results ..."".) 

This problem is causing extra work for the Wave Planner to identify the order with unplanned lines, their details, and the current inventory details for the unfilled lines.

*Business Requirements:*
# Replace the ""Go+"" icon in the Unfilled Lines field in the LDB Wave Management (wms_wv_f.wave_mgmt) search results view, with the count of unfilled order lines, with a hyperlink to the Dispatcher - Unfilled Lines views when the count is > 0.
> Determine the count of Unfilled Lines as the number of order lines for the orders planned for the Wave where the Unfilled Quantity > 0
> Display 0 with no hyperlink if the count is 0
> Display the count in {color:red}Red{color} bolded font if the count is > 0, and hyperlink the field
> Provide the capability for a user to mouse over a hyperlinked field to view or open the Dispatcher - Unfilled Lines view for the wave
> Rename the column to Unfilled Lines Count
 !screenshot-7.png|thumbnail! 
# Make the same changes to LDB Wave Management Read-Only (wms_wv_f.wave_mgmt_ro_ldb) 
# Add a new Search Criteria to the sub-view Dispatcher - Unfilled Lines (wms_od_f.dispatcher_unfilled_lines) called Unfilled Quantity
> Set the default to >0
> In the search results, display order lines with an unfilled quantity greater than the search criteria value
# Change the default search criteria for the sub-view Dispatcher - Unfilled Lines (wms_od_f.dispatcher_unfilled_lines) that is displayed as a pop-up when the user mouses over the Unfilled Lines count value as follows:
> Wave = Current Wave #
> Status = Blank (for all)
> Unfilled Quantity > 0
> Warehouse = based on the user's session parameter
# For the sub-view Dispatcher - Unfilled Lines, display the Unfilled Quantity value in the search results in {color:red}Red{color} bolded font if > 0. Retain the Inventory column which enables the Wave Planner to look for available inventory in the building for each Item
 !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail! 
 !screenshot-11.png|thumbnail! 
# On the Wave Management Details Screen, in the Orders view (LDB Wave Outbound Orders Sub-view) (wms_wv_om_f_sub_ldb) add a column Unfilled Lines Count. For each order, display the count of order lines with the Unfilled Quantity > 0. If the count >0, display the count in bold {color:red}Red{color} font. Otherwise display the count as 0.000 in regular font
# Make the same changes to the LDB Wave Outbound Orders Read-Only Sub-view) (wms_wv_om_f_sub_ro_ldb) 
# On the Wave Management Details Screen, in the Order Lines view (wms_wv_od_f_sub_ldb) , if the Unfilled Quantity >0 for an Order Line, display in bold {color:red}Red{color} font
 !screenshot-12.png|thumbnail! 
# On the Wave Management Header at the top of the screen in the summary section, if the Unfilled Quantity > 0.000 display the two new fields Unfilled Lines Count and Unfilled Quantity in Red font. Otherwise display the fields with a 0 quantity in regular font. Here is an example:
 !screenshot-10.png|thumbnail! 
# For the Order Lines view, if the Unfilled Quantity >0, add a column Inventory, and display Go+ with a link for each line. When the user clicks the link, pop-up the view Dispatcher - Inventory (the same view that is available in Dispatcher - Unfilled Lines. Add the new field to the right of Unfilled Quantity. See the screen sample
# For the Orders view, remove the columns Stop Sequence, Trailer ID, Freight Terms. and Pack and Mark Separately, and add the column Ship-To Name in their place for the Order. See the screen sample
# ON HOLD: LDB has a potential new requirement to add an action “Resolve Unfilled Quantity” to the action button for an Order Line – the need is for the Wave Planner to be able to click the action for an Order Line, and have Tecsys reduce the current Plan Quantity for the line by the Unfilled Quantity less the Schedule Quantity (i.e. automatically reduce the Plan Quantity to the inventory in FP and FIFO in the building that is available to schedule). This would save time, replacing the need for the Wave Planner  to edit the Plan Quantity for each line to resolve the Unfilled Quantity. Yes, this is a risky change that management would need to improve. The Wave Planners would be trained to always review the reason for the unfilled, and potential ways to resolve (e.g. put-away of a pallet in receiving) before selecting this action. It is assumed they do this today before editing the quantity and shorting the order. The same action would be required in the order lines header – to be able to select multiple lines and an resolved the unfilled for the selected lines.

*Business Impact*
This change will impact all the Wave Planners in a positive way, providing improved capability for them to identify and resolve unfilled lines when wave planning.

Prevent over-shipping: Plan Quantity less than or equal to the Quantity Ordered on LDB Wave Management (S023),DDCFUN-21,11694,Story,Completed,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,High,Done,david.robbins,ales.eisner,ales.eisner,26/Feb/19 3:05 PM,11/Jun/19 11:12 AM,26/Sep/19 3:41 PM,11/Jun/19 11:12 AM,,0,Wave_Planning,,"*Business Requirement:*
The business need is to avoid over-shipping an order.  The Wave Planner should not be able to have the Plan Quantity higher than the Ordered Quantity.

The screen where the Wave Planner can edit the Plan Quantity is LDB Wave Management > LDB Wave Outbound Order Details Subview

If the user changes the Plan Quantity for the order line to be greater than the Ordered Quantity
1. If the system can change the Plan Quantity, the Plan Quantity will be set to the same value as the Ordered Quantity a warning message will be shown ""The Plan Quantity must be less than or equal to Ordered Quantity.  The Plan Quantity value has been reset to the same value as the Ordered Quantity.""

2. If the system cannot change the Plan Quantity, an error message will be shown ""The Plan Quantity must be less than or equal to Ordered Quantity.  Please reset the Plan Quantity to the same or smaller value as the Ordered Quantity before releasing the wave.""

*Functional Requirements*:
The following functional changes are required to the screen where the Wave Planner can edit the Plan Quantity is LDB Wave Management > LDB Wave Outbound Order Details Subview
* If the Wave Planner performs a direct update of the Plan Quantity data field for the order line:
> to be X which is greater than the Ordered Quantity Y – they will receive a error message “Outbound Order Details: The Plan Quantity (X.000) must be less than or equal to Quantity Ordered (Y.000), and will not be able to submit the change
> to be less than 0 – they will receive a error message “Outbound Order Details: Plan Quantity can not be less than 0” and will not be able to submit the change
* If the Wave Planner selects the Action button and then Update Fields for an Order Line, and records and submits a Plan Quantity:
> to be X which is greater than the Ordered Quantity - the Plan Quantity change will not be made and the message will be shown “Outbound Order Details: The Plan Quantity (X.000) must be less than or equal to Quantity Ordered (Y.000).
> to be less than 0 – the Plan Quantity change will not be made  and the same message will be shown “Outbound Order Details: Plan Quantity can not be less than 0”
> For both scenarios, the Wave Planner can either Continue to accept the current Plan Quantity or perform another update to resolve the message

*Business Impact*
The change will impact the Wave Planners - preventing them from accidentally (or purposefully) allow an order line to be over picked and shipped, or from setting an invalid negative plan quantity

The Receiving team starts receipt planning as soon as the delivery truck driver provides the BOL. While the Purchase Orders (PO) is in the planned status in the WMS, the demand planning team can update all issued purchase orders. These updates are not limited to updating PO quantity or cancelling PO lines in all issued POs.  Through interfaces, all changes to the POs are transmitted near real-time.  Once the PO is planned in the WMS, it is locked in the WMS, and no further updates are permitted. All subsequent updates to the order will be failed in the WMS staging table. Further, the warehouse worker can continue to receive the planned PO in WMS; however, upon receipt is complete, the PO receipt fails to upload to eBiz and Legacy Purchasing for inventory update and trigger AP payments. 

*Stakeholders:*
-  LDB Liquor Wholesale Supply Chain
-  LDB Liquor Distribution
-  LDB Wholesale Finance

*Business Requirement:*
**POs:* 
-      Restrict Demand Planners updating in legacy purchasing (quantity increase or decrease) an issued PO when it has been planned for receipt at the warehouse. 
-        Restrict Demand Planners cancelling in legacy purchasing an issued PO when it has been planned for receipt at the warehouse. 
-      Restrict Demand Planners cancelling in legacy purchasing a line on an issued PO when it has been planned for receipt at the warehouse.
-	Restrict Demand Planners from force close a partially received PO when it is been planned for receipt at the warehouse. 
-      Provide Demand Planners with a message in legacy purchasing when they are trying to update/cancel an issued PO when it has been planned for receipt at the warehouse.
-	Provide Demand Planners with a message in legacy purchasing when they are trying to update/cancel an issued PO when PO status in WMS cannot be determined due to connectivity problems.

*EPOs:*
-      Restrict Demand Planners cancelling of an issued or overdue EPO when it has been planned for receipt at the warehouse.
-      Restrict Demand Planners force close of a partial received EPO when it has been planned for receipt at the warehouse.
-	Provide Demand Planners with a message in legacy purchasing when they are trying to update/cancel an issued EPO when the EPO status in WMS cannot be determined due to connectivity problems.
- 	All EPOs are unable to close during nightly batch job will be added to the log file.

Hello all,



We just completed a UAT session for the Legacy Purchasing changes. Ultimately, attendees confirmed the changes were functioning as expected, and we recommend these changes to be deployed to Production.



+*Attendees*+: Kevin, Phyllis, Roberto, Emily, Lauren



Here is a summary of the session, and the updated functionality:

1) The Delta / Vancouver radial button is gone. The remaining functionality remains the same.

{color:#36b37e}*2) If a PO has been planned at the DC, Demand Planners will no longer be able to search for it, or make changes to it. If they search for it, a message will pop up saying “*{color}{color:#36b37e}*_Unable to make a change because the PO is open in WMS_*{color}{color:#36b37e}*”*{color}

{color:#36b37e}*a. There is the possibility that if the Demand Planner have a PO open to make a change in Legacy Purchasing, and then the DC plans it, the change will still go through. This is purely a timing issue, and everyone agreed the chances of this happening is slim.*{color}

3) If the interface between WMS and Legacy Purchasing is down/not available, no POs will be available to change. If Demand Planners search for a PO, a message will pop up saying “_WMS Service is not available, please log a ticket with LDBHELP_.”

---------------



Thank you,



*Lauren Mackenzie*

I will discuss with John.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Receiving screen UOM to default to Cases only (Regular receiving) (S029),DDCFUN-36,12132,Story,Done,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,Highest,Done,tess.gotengco,david.robbins,david.robbins,29/Apr/19 2:39 PM,11/Jun/19 1:59 PM,26/Sep/19 3:41 PM,11/Jun/19 1:59 PM,,0,,,"*Business Problem:*
The current LDB Receiving mobile screen is defaults to a UOM and Input Quantity of BTL's. The Receiver can change the UOM to another valid UOM for the item, but this is an extra step and is ineffective. Calculating the number of bottles in the received cases is also ineffective and prone to error. Since Receiving only receives cases from suppliers, the UOM on the mobile screen should default to cases.

The business sponsor of this change is John Sweet

*Business Requirement:*
When the Receiver selects Inbound Order Receiving, and the LDB Receiving screen opens, when the SCC (container bar code) is scanned:
* The default Input is to display based on the UOM2 for the Item associated with the scanned SCC, and
* The Input Quantity is to default to 0
{* The received quantity is to be recorded as the Input Quantity * Item>Quantity of UOM1 in UOM2--NOT CORRECT}

Approved by James Revision as of May 11, 2019: Input Quantity received in the Unit of the UOM received
Example Received Qty = 4 Cases - Enter 4 in the Input Quantity field and default UOM should be CASE12 and displays 12.000 X BTL 

-Note: Some Items have a UOM1 = CASE1, and UOM2 = PALLET. The same solution applies for these items. PALLET will be the default UOM for receiving-. this is NOT CORRECT see Revision as of May 11,2019 below.

Approved by James: Revision as of May 11,2019 : Items with UOM1 = CASE and UOM2 = PALLET would  have a default receiving UOM as CASE; label printing should also be CASE (please see attached confirmed by Doug)

See attached screenshot for details. 
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

*Business Rationale:*
This change will impact all warehouse performing the Inbound - Receiver role.

This is to document the issue found by Chaminda when Internet Explorer is used as browser; the cursor from the UOM field goes directly to the Number of Labels field instead of the Input Quantity.  

The RF and wrist scanners use Andriod browser which is Chrome. Therefore to fix this issue where the receiver can mistakenly enter the Received Qty in the Number of Labels fields, the solution put forward by Daniel, is to move the UOM field before the Input Quantity field.

The rationale: this organizes the flow of entry and also standardizes the regular receiving with NSWP.

Receiving ability to update receiving pallets due to keying error before receipt closeout (S030),DDCFUN-64,11429,Story,Canceled,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,Medium,Done,chaminda.jayasekara,chaminda.jayasekara,chaminda.jayasekara,12/Dec/18 2:05 PM,22/Jul/19 2:09 PM,26/Sep/19 3:41 PM,22/Jul/19 2:09 PM,,0,Inbound,,"The LDB Distribution identified that out-of-box TECSYS needed to be modified to include the ability to correct receiving quantity before the receipt closeout. 

Current State / Background:

For various reasons, during the product receiving to DC, the receivers enter wrong quantity in the TECSYS WMS. If the PO quantity and user entered quantity matches, then the TECSYS WMS will consider the receipt is complete for that product. For an example, if the user made a data entry error, then there is no other option to correct it other than adjusting the inventory by selecting an adjustment code.    

Justification for the change:

This change ensures that TECSYS WMS inventory level reflects the correct receiving quantities, therefore, all LDB legacy systems to have accurate information for planning and billing etc. 
Further, by implementing this change request will require less manual processes such as coordinating with the inventory management team to adjust the inventory to correct received quantities and finance backend process like processing claimable adjustment requests from vendors.   

Alternative Option:

Make a modifications to how Oracle eBiz process claimable adjustment and accounts payable finance business process.

Hi, no the audit DB is not installed in PROD WMS Liquor. There is an issue which Tecsys / DBA needs to resolve concerning the trigger on the audit DB. With SQL replication (always on) with the trigger active there will be an issue with recovering the DB. If more info is needed ask the DBA. Until that issue is resolved, I wouldn't recommend turning it on.

Hello,

Can you, please, logon trigger is currently disabled in Liquor WMS INT 5 instance.

The only thing that this trigger does is to put database session information into this table: tecsys_admin.dbo.md_audit_db_session 

 If any other code later on relies on the information in this table, than you will get the error message that you are getting. 

 This is the information captured by the trigger:

       INSERT INTO tecsys_admin.dbo.md_audit_db_session(
       db_user,
       db_session,
       db_instance_name,
       app_host,
       app_ip,
       logon_success,
       logon_stamp,
       logoff_type,
       logoff_stamp)

Good afternoon.

There is an enhancement on Jira that needs to be deployed into production.

I believe this has already been deployed into INT1 by TECSYS without documenting the requirements.

We need to get together and shipshape this ticket before UAT and deploying into production.

[~chaminda.jayasekara], I saw the flowcharts you uploaded on Jira [here|https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/browse/WL0-1]. We need to also document the business requirements so that the QAs can create test scenarios. Have you got anything?

[~alvaro.sanchez] , did you make this change into INT1? Do you have any more details on this?

After getting your responses, I will schedule a meeting to plan the next steps.",27/Feb/19 1:40 PM;chaminda.jayasekara;I have added TECSYS provided document to attachments,"28/Feb/19 2:15 PM;reza.haddadi;Reviewed the documents and solution yesterday (Jan 27th).

However, user/s to do testing need to be assigned wms_administrator role for them to be able to access the resources to test.","12/Mar/19 8:58 PM;alvaro.sanchez;While testing in INT1 I've discovered a very important factor to take into account - inventory can't be received into a location that is not a receiving location if the 'Release for Putaway' flag is set to 'No'. The 'Release for Putaway' flag is currently not part of the NSWP receiving workflow so if an item configured with the 'Default Release for Putaway' flag set to No in pm_f, then the user will get an error message when they try to receive it. 

There is a decision to make here - do we add the Release for Putaway field in the NSWP receiving workflow for the user to set it to 'Yes' when they are receiving or do we make the assumption that NSWP items will be configured with the 'Default Release for Putaway' flag set to Yes in pm_f?","13/Mar/19 9:34 PM;alvaro.sanchez;Following today's UAT session, it was determined that a second UAT session would be needed for this change. Prior to this second UAT session, a meeting will be scheduled with the business to clarify the requirements. The second UAT session should also be more organized than the first - the inbound orders containing NSWP items should be created beforehand and barcodes for the items and receiving locations should be printed out for the session.

The following will also need to be added to the documentation for this ticket: The user who will be receiving NSWP items will need to set their Station to 'NSWP' in their session parameters prior to receiving. This station has no default receiving location and is not associated to any printers.","21/Mar/19 11:33 AM;tess.gotengco;This is approved additional requirement as per meeting with the business:

*      No default receiving location (No default location)
*      Personalized Location View where parameter equals  default Section = S-NSWP and Empty=Y (Yes)

*     Input UOM is defaulted to Case but should still be visible but should not be adjustable
*    Add the field called “Release for Putaway”   Information only: the items table holds the default value of “Release for Putaway”
*    The default value will be automatically shown in the NSWP screen coming from items table configuration as-is
*    If the default value of the Release Putaway equals “No” then the Receiver should change to “Yes”.      Information only: inventory can't be received into a location that is not a receiving location if the 'Release for Putaway' flag is set to 'No'

My understanding is that there can be no shippable units against the carrier service.  These need to be cleared from the following table ca_f, ca_st_ldb, and wms_up_f.

LDB Forecasted Replenishment view (S041),DDCFUN-46,11755,Story,Done,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,Medium,Done,david.robbins,james.laitinen,james.laitinen,05/Mar/19 3:03 PM,22/May/19 5:15 PM,26/Sep/19 3:41 PM,25/Apr/19 9:27 AM,,0,,,"*Business Problem:*

Refreshment beverages are often allocated to stores in large volumes. The pick slot setup for an item usually contains 50 cases. When a vendor issues an allocation of 5000 cases to the warehouse, and the stores for the promotion each receive one pallet, the forward pick slot is then picked, and replenished over and over again causing delays in processing the orders. The business is requesting a view to calculate the total volume of a SKU, the pick slot qty, and produce a set of numbers for the inventory control team to review to adjust the number of pick slots for a SKU.

The requester and management sponsor of this new capability is John Sweet.

*Business Requirements:*

1. Create a new view called LDB Forecasted Replenishment. Add the new view to the menu @ Inventory Management > Replenishment. Provide the following search criteria:

* Item (with Lookup)
* Forecasted Replenishment Counts (Default to > 1)
* Warehouse

2. Provide the following roles with view only access to the view:
Managers
Wave Planner
Wave Planner \- Read Only
Supervisor
Assistant Supervisor
Inventory Management
Inventory Management \- Cycle Count
Inventory Management \- Read Only
Inventory Management \- Recoup/Cleanup
Inventory Management \- Staff
Receiver Floor / Office

3. Provide the following columns in the search results. Include the standard Print, Export to Excel, and Generate Graph function icons for the search results. Sort by Forecasted Replenishment \# Counts descending. All numeric columns to be displayed right justified. Column headings to be wrapped as 3 lines to minimize column width

*A. Item*
> Only items with an open order quantity and a case FP location are to be listed as follows.
For each item in the item master, include the item in the search result when:

* The total plan quantity for all order details for the item is > 0 (only items with a current order demand are to be listed), and
* The item is defined as a Forward Pick Item for at least one location for locations with Area = APCK, SCAGE, or SCAGEP (bottle tower FP locations are to be excluded)

*B. Description*
> The Item description

*C. Replenishment UOM*
> Display the Replenishment UOM for the Case FP location for the item. If there are 2 or more FP locations, select the UOM for the first location selected
> Assumption: If there are multiple case FP locations, they will all have the same Replenishment UOM, and the Replenishment UOM will equal the item's UOM 2 (or UOM 1 for CASE1)

*D. Forward Pick Locations*
> Select the location with type = FP and in area APCK, SCAGE, or SCAGEP where the item = the location Forward Pick Item
> Display the count of FP locations in the format N\+ with a link to a sub-view
> When the user hovers over the count or the link is clicked a sub-view is to be displayed that displays the following columns: Location, Maximum FP Location Capacity, Replenishment UOM

*E. Order Qty Unplanned*
> Total of the outbound order details > Plan Quantity for the Item where the Order status = HOLD, BLD, IHLD, or IPLN (plus SPLN, SSPL, and SSRL added Mar 21 2019)
> The quantity is to be reported according to the FP Location Replenishment UOM not the Order UOM. The order quantity is to be converted from BTL to Replenishment UOM units using the value of Item> Quantity of UOM 1 in UOM 2, except for the scenario where Replenishment UOM = Item > UOM1
>e.g. if the order item plan quantity = 48, the Replenishment UOM = CASE24, the Order UOM = BTL, and the Item>Quantity of UOM 1 in UOM 2 = 24, then the quantity to be reported = 2
> The scenario of Replenishment UOM = UOM1 will apply for the UOM CASE1. For this scenario, the order quantity does not require conversion since it is already in the same units as the Replenishment UOM

*F. Order Qty Planned Unpicked*
> Total of the outbound order details > Plan Quantity for the Item where the Order status = PLN, RDY, or IRLS, (plus SRLS and SUSP added March 21 2019) excluding the quantity that has been picked and excluding the quantity to be picked from a current location that is not of type FP
> The same requirements as described in E for reporting the quantity using the Replenishment UOM apply for this column as well
> Determine the total planned order quantity, and then +reduce+ the total quantity by:
1) the quantity of cases picked. The cases picked is the sum of the Quantity Processed for Logged Transactions where Outbound Order = Outbound Order Details>Order, Outbound Order Line = Outbound Order Details>Order Line \[Item\], From Location = FP or FIFO location for the item, and Task = RPCK. Order Details with status PLN, RDY, IRLS, SRLS and SUSP  as well as HOLD, BLD, IHLD, IPLN, SPLN, SSPL, and SSRL \[to handle the potential case of a pick that has been completed for an unplanned order\] are to reported. Logged Transactions for orders that have been completed and are no longer in Order Details are to be excluded from the picked quantity, +plus+
2) the quantity of cases to be picked from a location that is not type Forward Pick (FP). This is the sum of the Quantity for Queued Commands where Task = PICK, To Container is not blank, Outbound Order = Outbound Order Details>Order, Item, and Current Location is +not+ assigned the Type = FP

*G. Order Qty Total*= Order Qty Unplanned \+ Order Qty Planned Unpicked

*H. Dynamic Replenishment Qty*
> Total of the Location > Dynamic Replenishment Quantity quantity for the location(s) selected as the Forward Pick Location for the Item (in Area =APCK, SCAGE, or SCAGEP only)
> The quantity is to be reported according to the Replenishment UOM as described in E

*I. Reserve Inventory Qty*
> Total Inventory>Current Bottle Quantity of the item for the location(s) with type = FIFO
> The quantity is to be reported according to the Replenishment UOM as described in E

*J. Receiving Inventory Qty*
> Total Inventory>Current Bottle Quantity for the item for the location(s) with type = RECV
> The quantity is to be reported according to the Replenishment UOM as described in E

*K. Forecasted Replenishment Count Total* = Order Qty Total / Dynamic Replenishment Quantity
> The Count result is to be reported with one decimal place
> Sum the total Dynamic Replenishment Quantity for each FP location if there is more than one.

*L. Forecasted Replenishment Count Planned Unpicked* = Order Qty Planned Unpicked / Dynamic Replenishment Quantity
> The Count result is to be reported with one decimal place
> Sum the total Dynamic Replenishment Quantity for each FP location if there is more than one.

*M. Forecasted Replenishment Count Unplanned* = Order Qty Unplanned / Dynamic Replenishment Quantity
> The Count result is to be reported with one decimal place
> Sum the total Dynamic Replenishment Quantity for each FP location if there is more than one. Most items have only one case pick FP location. As per the requirements above, we are only considering the case pick locations (based on Area), and not including the bottle pick locations in the sum

*Example:*
Order Qty Unplanned = 2500.000
Order Qty Planned = 2500.000
Order Qty Total = 5000.000
Dynamic Replenishment Qty = 50.000
Inventory Qty Reserve = 4850.00
Inventory Qty Receiving = 150.0
Forecasted Replenishment Count Total = 100.0
Forecasted Replenishment Count Planned = 50.0
Forecasted Replenishment Count Unplanned = 50.0

*Expected outcome*
Inventory control sorts the view and adjusts the number of pick slots for an item based on the number of forecasted replenishments.",,david.robbins,james.laitinen,jason.chen,sandeep.sangi,sandy.leiper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08/Apr/19 10:13 AM;david.robbins;WLO-127- User Acceptance Testing - INT1 5APR2019.docx;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10330/WLO-127-+User+Acceptance+Testing+-+INT1+5APR2019.docx,04/Apr/19 11:29 AM;david.robbins;WLO-127- User Acceptance Testing - INT3 21Mar2019 (fc673632-1d27-43e5-bec0-7a6dca2153d1).docx;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10326/WLO-127-+User+Acceptance+Testing+-+INT3+21Mar2019+%28fc673632-1d27-43e5-bec0-7a6dca2153d1%29.docx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,david.robbins,,S041,,,,,, ,{},,,,,,, ,, ,, ,, ,,,,, ,, ,,,,,1|i009gh:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WMS-DDC Team Blue Active Work,,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-03-06 19:17:41.992,06/Mar/19 11:17 AM;david.robbins;[~brad.rykenhuizen] I have refined the requirements for this new ticket added yesterday.

Prevent commands for containers in BTL-QA and QA locations from being suspended (S043),DDCFUN-788,12996,Story,Fit Gap Analysis,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,High,,craig.kelly,david.robbins,david.robbins,17/Jun/19 3:47 PM,23/Aug/19 5:27 PM,26/Sep/19 3:41 PM,,,0,,,"*Business Problem*
Today, when a container is weighed at the Bottle Tower QA station, if the physical weight of the container does not closely match the weight the container should be based on Tecsys calculations using item and container type master data, the container is diverted to a BTL-QA location and the command is paused. The same occurs at the pallet QA location (when it is turned on).
The current design assumes the weight discrepancy must be resolved, and the container re-weighed before it can be sent to the next location. Currently if the user executes a Container Pick Complete command for the container while it is BTL-QA, the command is suspended. However, this status is not displayed, and the container can be moved to consolidation, wrapping, etc. This results in downstream issues, since, once a container is suspended, shipment documentation cannot be generated and the shipment cannot be released. Since there is no ""UN-suspend"" capability currently, IT support is required to fix suspended command issues.

*Business Requirement*

If the result of any action should result in the change in status of a command to a status of suspended (SUSP) then command should not be allowed and the message “This Container is currently in QA, do you wish to override QA” Y/N?

If the answer is No then the action should error out and no further change should occur.

If the Answer is Yes then the action should be allowed to occur and the command processed as if the container is not in QA. It SHOULD NOT result in a command been placed in SUSP status. The override should be seen indicate that the QA issue has been resolved.

Example of where this might occur are:

Move

Container Complete

Container Nest

Container Merge

Container Unpack

*-Business Requirement-*
-The following commands should not be allowed for containers in a BTL-QA or QA location. The message displayed for each command is to be displayed instead in bold, red font. The user must not be able to press Continue for the command, and must instead select Close:-

* -Move - The container cannot be moved from QA location (implemented in Patch # 2 for DDCFUN-7)-

When a bottle pick container is weighed on the third floor of the bottle pick tower, the container is automatically diverted to a QA location when Inventory QA can check for and resolve the over / under weight issue.  When the container is diverted, it is automatically moved from CNSOLIDATE to BTL-QA with a status of PAUS. The QA role then resolves the issue and places the container back on the conveyor to repeat the weight checks. Resolution may involve removing over picked bottles, or filling the box with bottles that were counted by not placed in the box. The QA person can also adjust the weight of the container to match the scale weight. For example, a weight adjustment is required if the container was not closed correctly by the Assembler and therefore has a 0.0 weight in Tecsys (the container weights are recorded on container close based on the item master and container type weight master data.
If a QA or other user uses a Move or Container Pick Compete commands to move a container from a QA location with a PAUS'd PICK command, the command is changed to suspended status, preventing any further processing of the container, including ship complete. If the container is still on site, the only way for DDC Operations to resolve the SUSP status is to physically return the container to BTL-QA to be re-weighed on the scale. If the container has been nested and wrapped, or has left the building, the only resolution is for an IT person to make data adjustments to enable invoicing.
Resolving suspended commands has a significant impact on operation, and is causing shipment documentation and invoicing issues

*Stakeholders:*

John Sweet, Ken McDonnell

*Business Requirement:*

Do not allow users to use the ‘move’ command when the container is in QA or BTL-QA locations.

*Business Impact:*

* Prevented the shipment from shipment completion
* IT have to run SQL scripts to get shipment completion

*Solution:*

The required solution has been modified since it was originally designed by Tecsys. The original design documentation for the patch is presented in a section below. This solution has been rejected, and replaced with the following solution. In addition, a separate ticket has been created for ""part 2"" of S043 which will focus on preventing users from using a command that will change the status of the command from PAUS to SUSP. ""Part 1"" will be implemented as ""Patch # 2"" from Tecsys, ""part 2"" will be developed and implemented separately.
The solution for Patch # 2 is to prevent a user from using the Mobile WMS>Inventory>Move command to change the location of a container that is currently BTL-QA (or QA). The message ""The container cannot be moved from QA location"" is to be displayed as illustrated below.
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 
The current logic which suspends the command if the use uses Container PIck Complete, Container Merge or Unpack, or Container Nest is to be retained for this patch. I will be changed in ""Part 2"" of this QA change.

*Business Rational / Impacts:*

This change will impact workers in Bottle Pick QA and Wrapper QA. They no longer will be able to use the Move command, and will use a different workflow when inspection is triggered.
The change will benefit the ""shipping office"" team who need to deal with suspended commands and request correction from IT. It will also save investigation time from IT. Also there will be reduced late deliveries due to stuck transactions
Based on an analysis of 2 months of Move transactions, the use of the Move command from a QA location has been very infrequent. Also, the Wrapper scales are currently not functioning (please refer to linked issue)

*Steps to Reproduce the Issue*
To reproduce the issue, for the Bottle Pick Tower when a container that fails inspection e.g. weight and is diverted to the BTL-QA location, a user can use the Mobile WMS>Move command to assign the container to a new next location. This should not be possible. The same is occurring for the Pallet Wrapper QA location. In INT1, a PICK transaction (not a MOVE) is recorded.

*Expected Steps / Results*
It should not be possible or required for a user to use a Move command to move the container to another location while at BTL-QA. The same objectives apply for the Pallet Wrapper for a pallet that fail inspection and requires an unpack and inspection.

This QA process should be tested with the following scenarios (as documented in the IM Quality Assurance training guide):
* Scanned weight is '0' - pass the container through QA again to reread the CPRE
* Weight of container is high or low due to extra, too few or wrong bottles / cases in the container - remove / add items to the container and re-scan to pass QA
* Weight is high - pick is correct - build a new container and unpack bottles form container that failed QA to new container and re-scan
* Nested Bottle Pick Case is in Bottle Pick QA for a B Container Pallet that is rejected - Unpack the BP Case and send the BP case back to BP QA, then complete the Pallet Wrapper QA

*Summary of the Initial Tecsys Design*
The following is an extract from the Technical Design Document documents regarding the Tecsys patches for the Pick Tower and Pallet Wrapper interface and Container Pick Complete resource provided with RFI-20959. Please refer to the full documents attached to this ticket for a complete definition of the processes. This solution was rejected by LDB the week of June 10 2019

+Pallet Wrapper+
# When the container is placed on the automatic pallet wrapper, the container id is scanned and the pallet is weighed. The weight is then validated by WMS.
# If inspection is required (weight validation fails), WMS will:
* Set the current location of the current command to a QA location, which is defined in Warehouse Options
* Send a response back to the Wrapper system indicating that inspection is required

Hey again Alvaro,

I was doing a quick test on this, and I was able to move something from the QA location without any issues. Which is not what I expected with the requirement below:

Do not allow users to use the ‘move’ command when the container is in QA or BTL-QA locations.

Looking at the tec spec, is says nothing about blocking the move command I have in the requirements but more of a proper path to move out of qa using container pick complete.

There seems to be a discrepancy in the issue and the solution, am I missing something? 
_______________________________________________________","18/Mar/19 1:29 PM;alvaro.sanchez;Hi Brad, you're right. I've compared the Business Requirements documents and the Technical Design Documents for the changes to this mod and while the BR documents for both the Pick Tower and Pallet wrapper include the following line: ""_When a container is in QA location, personnel should not be able to move it to another location by using the Move workflow_"", there is no reference to this in the Technical Design Documents. I will be discussing with the Tecsys EBS team to get an estimate of the timeline for developing this requirement.",03/Apr/19 3:20 PM;brad.rykenhuizen;I have emailed [~alvaro.sanchez] for an update,30/Apr/19 4:16 PM;david.robbins;[~brad.rykenhuizen] Did you ever hear an update on this ticket from TECSYS.

Change By:

Dave Robbins <https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?accountId=5c461ce585c9b117bae2f075>


*Business Problem*:
When a QA user attempts to make a move command out of QA, the command get stuck in suspended status.

*Stakeholders:*

John Sweet, Ken McDonnell

*Business Requirement:*

Do not allow users to use the ‘move’ command when the container is in QA or BTL-QA locations.

*Business Impact:*

* Prevented the shipment from shipment completion
* IT have to run SQL scripts to get shipment completion

*Solution:*

The following is an extract from the Technical Design Document documents regarding the Tecsys patches for the Pick Tower and Pallet Wrapper interface and Container Pick Complete resource provided with RFI-20959. Please refer to the full documents attached to this ticket for a complete definition of the processes.

+Pallet Wrapper+
# When the container is placed on the automatic pallet wrapper, the container id is scanned and the pallet is weighed. The weight is then validated by WMS.
# If inspection is required (weight validation fails), WMS will:
* Set the current location of the current command to a QA location, which is defined in Warehouse Options
* Send a response back to the Wrapper system indicating that inspection is required
* When the container arrives in the QA location, a user will run the WMS resource “Container Pick Complete”.

+Bottle Pick Tower+
# When the container arrives at Module 2, the Pick Tower system sends a web service request to WMS with a container ID and its weight.
# WMS runs its logic to determine if inspection is required for the container using predefined rules and setups.
# If inspection is required, WMS will:
* Set the current location of the current command to the Bottle Pick QA Location field defined in the Warehouse Options.
* Send a response back to Module 2 with information on whether the container needs to be inspected or not.
* Divert the container to a QA location, which is defined in Warehouse Options.
* When the container arrives in the QA location, the user will run the WMS resource “Container Pick Complete” to do the following steps:
on Module 2 again.
on a conveyer that leads to Module3 instead of Module2.

*Business Rational / Impacts:*

This change will impact workers in Bottle Pick QA and Wrapper QA. They no longer will be able to use the Move command, and will use a different workflow when inspection is triggered.
The change will benefit the ""shipping office"" team who need to deal with suspended commands and request correction from IT. It will also save investigation time from IT. Also there will be reduced late deliveries due to stuck transactions
Based on an analysis of 2 months of Move transactions, the use of the Move command from a QA location has been very infrequent. Also, the Wrapper scales are currently not functioning (please refer to linked issue)

*Steps to Reproduce the Issue*
To reproduce the issue, for the Bottle Pick Tower and for when a case container that fails inspection e.g. weight and is diverted to the BTL-QA location, it a user can use the Mobile WMS>Move command to assign the container to a new next location. This should not be possible . The same is occurring for the Pallet Wrapper QA location. In INT1, a PICK transaction (not a MOVE) is recorded.

*Expected Steps / Results*
It should not be possible or required for a user to use a Move command to move the container to another location while at BTL-QA , and . In stead the new procedure Container Pick Completed workflow steps described above should are to be an improvement on the current procedure used .
The same objectives apply for the Pallet Wrapper for a pallet that fail inspection and requires an unpack and inspection.
The attached Tecsys documents provide good detail on the intended procedure and steps .

_Note: As This QA process should be tested with the following scenarios (as documented in the comments below IM Quality Assurance training guide):
* Scanned weight is '0' - pass the container through QA again to reread the CPRE
* Weight of container is high or low due to extra , too few or wrong bottles / cases in the container - remove / add items to the container and re-scan to pass QA
* Weight is high - pick is correct - build a new container and unpack bottles form container that failed QA to new container and re-scan
* Nested Bottle Pick Case is in Bottle Pick QA for a B Container Pallet that is rejected - Unpack the BP Case and send the BP case back to BP QA, then complete the Pallet Wrapper QA

_Note: It appears that the patch does not prevent a Move command from being executed. Based on a discussion with Bikram, Bob, and Brad on May 3, we agreed to proceed with testing the patch at least for SIT and then meet to confirm it does address the requirement, and avoid the creation of suspended commands. If we determine the patch does not meet the need after SIT, LDB will contact Tecsys for clarification / changes to the patch_

The TecSys SDD introduced a new process that allows for the QA'd container to bypass the QA process or to be processed in QA however it kicks off a QA process that is not used to any extent. 
The TecSys SDD does not address the main requirement and indeed makes no mention of limiting the use of the Move command. 
Further it is not necessarily the move command at issue here, Move is a generic term and in the DDC it is used in many places to describe the movement of a instance of inventory from location to the next, not necessarily by using the TecSys ""Move"" functionality.
For Bottle Picks that were diverted to QA and were not subsequently dealt with correctly it is entirely possible that a PHYSICAL move was made bypassing the scales and allowing the case to travel to the consolidated area after which a NEST was carried out which results in the suspended command not being clear which will then subsequently block further actions i.e. Ship Complete, Re-Wave, etc...

Full pallet pick from forward pick location being generated in pallets (S051),DDCFUN-849,12104,Story,Ready for UAT,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,High,,craig.kelly,david.robbins,david.robbins,29/Apr/19 1:38 PM,20/Aug/19 11:01 AM,26/Sep/19 3:41 PM,,,0,,,"If the only inventory in the warehouse is in the forward pick (i.e. there is no pallet in storage), and a full load/pallet pick occurs, and there is enough inventory in the FP to pick a full pallet, the picker will get a pick for 1 pallet (please see example attached, showing a 1 pallet pick from a Forward Pick location - the pick was for 2 cases, for a SKU where 2 cases are a full pallet), rather than for X cases. This occurs extremely infrequently.

Because of the rarity of this situation, the picker doesn't notice the UOM on the picking screen is pallet instead of case, and physically picks only one case, but enters the pick as the full pallet by typing in the quantity of 1.

*Business problem:* This causes problems with over billing, shorting the pick physically, and having the inventory in the FP location incorrect (understated in the system). This happens rarely, but has a significant impact, so is rated as High priority.

The full pallet pick from a FP location should be given to the picker/assembler, not the replen driver. The picker is getting the pick currently, and that needs to stay as is. 
*The business requirement:* Ensure the picker is clear on the UOM for their pick, and picks the correct quantity/UOM.
*The functional requirement:* The system must be able to differentiate by Area the UOM to show the picker.  For example, the UOM shown for the floor must be in cases e.g. 56 cases, instead of 1 Pallet.  

It was discussed, and highlighting the pallet UOM in red, or flashing, instead of showing the quantity in cases, would not help, since the picker would get confused as to what to do and stop picking. Further s/he wouldn't necessarily know how many cases comprise a pallet of the particular SKU.

Possible process change: The picker can use the pallet mover to get the full pallet, and place their previously picked cases on top of the full pallet, and put the now-empty pallet they were using originally in the FP. This would be at the discretion of the picker, since they might have picked enough cases previously to make the new pallet too tall.

*Functional Requirements: screen mockups are below*

2.	There is unfortunately no way in WMS to specify a single UOM can be picked out of a FP location. There is only the Trigger Point UOM which determines the lowest UOM that can be picked from the FP locations (e.g. CASES for the FP in the case-pick locations and BTL in the bottle-pick locations). Juliana’s solution (change the Command UOM for all items to CASE instead of PALLET) would be one way to go about it but the implication of this is that no full pallet picks (even from a FIFO location) would be displayed as ‘1 PALLET’ anymore, they would all be displayed as ‘X CASES’. It wouldn’t impact picks from the bottle-pick tower since what the Command UOM defines is the largest possible UOM that could be displayed for a command so changing from PALLET to CASE wouldn’t make a difference.
Since it doesn’t seem convenient for all of the regular full-pallet picks to be displayed as ‘X CASES’, I think that the process change that you suggested would be the best way to go about it. We could even add a warning message to let the assembler know that it will be a full-pallet pick if that would help.
","08/May/19 8:54 AM;ales.eisner;Email from Juliana Tue 5/7/2019 2:20 PM:
I don’t have a lot of ideas on how to do this in the system. As installed with the functionality available there is no means to control the unit conversion that I know, the user can always change it to a different unit but of course the problem is that the users doesn’t notice that it is not the expected unit... All solutions I can think of would involve Tecsys doing some change in the system. Some ideas are:
•	Have code that only allows UOM1 and UOM2 to display as option
•	Have a flashing red light when the unit is different then UOM1 and UOM2
•	Or both

But maybe Alvaro can think of something else.
","09/May/19 2:05 PM;ales.eisner;Alvaro, Juliana & Jason suggestions May 9/19 - all independent of each other:
1. Change Command UOM setting to Cases for each Item (system wide, would have to be for all products everywhere) to indicate the largest UOM to show; this would cause replenishments to be shown in cases also, but replen drivers know they are getting a pallet
2. In addition to the previously-dismissed option of the screen changes to have a larger or red UOM, change the CPRE to have a marker when a pallet is being picked from the FP; the picker may not notice it, and still not know how many cases to get
3. Do a Mod, where we create a new ""Forward Pick UOM"" for an Area, which would override the Command UOM for the Item, and allow us to specify Cases to be the UOM for the floor, and bottles for the bottle pick tower",16/May/19 11:39 AM;bikram.kahlon;Can you please reproduce this issue in INT3 and record the step. ,"16/May/19 1:06 PM;ales.eisner;May 16: Spoke with John Sweet, who indicated highlighting the UOM or the marker on the CPRE are not viable solutions (#2).  

The Command UOM (#1) is not acceptable because it doesn't help on the BP Tower, since they will still get cases, as that will have to be the Command UOM for most SKUs.

I determined that the requirements are not being met. The requirement is to always display the pick quantity and UOM in cases instead of 1 PALLET whenever the PICK quantity equates to the the pallet quantity for the item. For Nilesh’s test I am noticing 1 PALLET is displayed. I retested for container C1006331 and received the same result. I am re-assigning [~lauren.mackenzie] as the BSA as she will be leading the UAT once this is corrected and re QA’d

the input uom = PALLET,

the area is a case-pick-area, which is defined in LDB WMS System Properties (currently APCK, ACAG, INVM), and 

the location type is FP.

Only if all above is true, then the code converts the uom/qty to cases.

Please re-test in INT3.  INT1 is not available right now.  Once INT1 becomes available, I’ll deploy the changes to INT1.

As per the QA tests attached, Nilesh tested two scenarios:

a) the location type is FIFO, and the area is ARSV, which is not a case-pick-area.  The uom/qty (PALLET) are not converted.

b) the location type is FP, and the area is APCK (case-pick-area).

A pallet pick from FIFO / reserve should be displayed as X PALLET and a pallet pick from FP / case pick should be displayed as Y CASE*. 

However, when checking Nilesh’s second test sample where the pick was for 56 CASE12’s, for some reason the pick was split into two picks - one for 3 CASE12 and one for 53 CASE12. I suspect the reason is because the 53 cases met the max weight for the container type, and the last 3 cases were scheduled for a second container. Please confirm that is true and / or retest to confirm the pallet quantity is not being split for some other reason. I am going to assign the status to QA, not Development. Thanks Dave","12/Jul/19 4:30 PM;david.robbins;[~lauren.mackenzie] I have updated the test script attached to [https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/browse/DDCFUN-19|https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/browse/DDCFUN-19|smart-link]

#  Can you please check whether the second test sample split because the max weight of the pallet was reached?
# Can you complete another test for pallet quantities of the following:

Additional information needs to be displayed for the business on the Pick by Order view (originally JIRA WMSL-315 (Pick by Order View) that wasn't implemented for Pick by Container Go Live on Feb 22, 2019). Additional information is required to manage the picking process and highlight replenishment or cycle count activities that may be affecting or stopping the picking of an order.

The requester and management sponsor for these changes is John Sweet

*Business Requirements:*

1. Add the following fields to the Search Criteria: -Carrier (with lookup)-, Wave, Ship-To Customer (with lookup), and Ship-To Name (with lookup). Please refer to the attached screenshot for placement. The Carrier is to be derived using the Carrier Service for the Order
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

2. Add the following columns to the search results: -Carrier-, Wave, Ship-To Customer, and Ship-To Name (plus the new columns listed below). Please refer to the attached screenshot for placement

3. Change the sort of the search results to by Ship Date Time ascending (earliest ship date time listed first)

4. Add the 2 standard function icons for search results: Print, Export to Excel

5. Rename the column Short Picks / Replens Occurred to # Open SP Container Picks / Pieces
>Two counts are to be reported - the count of PICK Queued commands  for the order where the To Container starts with SP*, and a sum of the pieces to picked for each PICK command counted
> The count is to be formatted as NN/NN+ and highlighted with a link that the user can mouse over to display the LDB Order Pick Commands sub-view
> For Orders with a reported short-pick, the count is to be displayed in {color:red}Red{color} font (as it is today)
> When the link is moused over or clicked by the user, pop-up the LDB Order Pick Commands sub-view of the PICK commands that are included in the count. The columns to be included in the sub-view follow:
* Status
* Locked By
* Task
* Item
* Tag
* Container
* Type
* To Container
* To-Container Type
* Current Location
* Actual Location
* Next Location
* Destination Location
* Quantity
* Pieces
* Availability
> This is the same as the current view with one addition: Add the new column # Pieces from the Queued Command to the right of Quantity in the sub-view LDB Order Pick Commands

6. Rename the column # of Open Pick Commands to # Open C Container Picks / Pieces
> Provide the same counts of picks commands and pieces as for #5, with the only difference being the To Container starts with C*

7. Rename the column # of Open Replens to # Open Replenishment Commands
> This is a change from the current solution which is counting the # of SP or C Container PICK commands for the order in PAUR status
> Instead, report the count of queued REPL commands with a Destination Location for which there is a Queued PICK command for the same Current Location _*in PAUR status*_ for the order (one or more of the locations counted in columns 5, or 6). 
> When the user mouses over the count, the same LDB Order Pick Commands view will display the list of REPL commands counted

8. Add a new column # Open Cycle Count Commands
> Report the count of queued CYCC commands for a location for which there is a Queued PICK command for the order (one or more of the locations counted in columns 5, 6, and 7). 
> The count is to be highlighted with a link and +. 
> When the link is moused over or clicked, the same LDB Order Pick Command sub-view of CYCC commands that are included in the count is to be displayed. 

9. Add the search criteria Pick Exists to the More Search Criteria, with a default value of Y
> The business requires the ability to focus or filter the view results to display only the picks that are left to complete.
> If Pick Exists = Y, the view will only display orders which have an non-zero SP* or C* command 
> If Pick Exists = Null, then all orders will be listed irrespective of whether there is an open PICK command
> If Pick Exists = N, the view will only display orders which have 0 counts for both SP* and  C* commands (picking is completed)",,ales.eisner,bob.kang,brad.rykenhuizen,david.robbins,nilesh.maha,sandy.leiper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01/Apr/19 11:46 AM;brad.rykenhuizen;MD-Tool - PickByOrder.xlsm;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10315/MD-Tool+-+PickByOrder.xlsm,03/Apr/19 4:11 PM;nilesh.maha;Replenishment Scenario- JIRAWL0-36.docx;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10322/Replenishment+Scenario-+JIRAWL0-36.docx,02/Apr/19 4:21 PM;nilesh.maha;SIT - Pick by Order- SP Containers -Jira0-36.docx;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10316/SIT+-+Pick+by+Order-+SP+Containers+-Jira0-36.docx,02/Apr/19 4:21 PM;nilesh.maha;SIT -Pick by Order - Cycle count.docx;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10317/SIT+-Pick+by+Order+-+Cycle+count.docx,04/Apr/19 11:23 AM;david.robbins;WLO-36 - User Acceptance Testing.docx;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10324/WLO-36+-+User+Acceptance+Testing.docx,06/Mar/19 2:53 PM;david.robbins;screenshot-2.png;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10257/screenshot-2.png,06/Mar/19 2:53 PM;david.robbins;screenshot-3.png;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10258/screenshot-3.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,david.robbins,,S054,,,,,, ,{},,,,,,, ,, ,, ,, ,,,,, ,, ,,,,hubert.xu,1|i008xy:d,,,,,jason.chen,,,,,,,,,,WMS-DDC Team Red Sprint 2,,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-03-06 22:54:59.633,06/Mar/19 2:54 PM;david.robbins;[~brad.rykenhuizen] and [~sandeep.sangi] The requirements are now updated and ready for your review / design / development / QA ,"11/Mar/19 12:00 PM;brad.rykenhuizen;Fist round of questions above in {{*Bold*}}, for [~david.robbins].

Make the following changes to the LDB Stagers’ View:

1. Add a column for Door location, named ""Containers in Door"", and separate those values from the ""Containers in all other Locations"", and put it left of ""Containers in all other Locations""

2. Narrow columns, and make labels 3 lines - many columns have a single digit number, but thanks to the labels are very wide

Currently the warehouse code and order ID are used as the key, but there can be multiple records with the same warehouse code and same order ID.  For these records, the Details view shows an error.  This issue has been there since the beginning, and is in PROD.  The fix will no be trivial, as the database view needs to be updated to expose a unique key, and the view configuration needs to be updated too.  

The Details view does not provide the user any more info.  Please let me know if we should teach the users not to use the Details view, or to make the effort to fix the error.  This story has a low priority.

Subject: DDCFUN-31 Pick by Order workflow should show Container instead of Tag (S054)

Hi Dave,

We need to re-visit the solution for this ticket.  The first decision is about the correct workflow to be used for Pick by Order.

In PROD, the workflow is wms_pick.wf, which shows screen LDB Confirm Pick Command:
[cid:image009.jpg@01D5154A.5D046530]

In INT3 and INT1, the workflow is wms_pick_ldb.wf, which shows screen Confirm and Complete Pick Command:
[cid:image010.jpg@01D5154A.5D046530]

In a recent deployment, wms_pick_ldb.wf (INT3/1) was deployed to PROD, but the warehouse reported a problem.  Please see Steven Turner's email attached (at the bottom of the thread).  The deployment has been rolled back in PROD.  It seems to me that Pick by Order should use workflow wms_pick.wf which displays screen LDB Confirm Pick Command.  Please confirm.

If the decision is to keep using wms_pick.wf for Pick by Order, we'll add container number to screen LDB Confirm Pick Command.  Please confirm.

Thanks,

With SSO enabled, users were routed to the IDIR login page. Since this IDIR login web page did not have responsive web design, it was difficult for users to login to the Tecsys application on the hand-held devices. To address this problem, SSO was disabled so users would be routed to Tecsys login page, instead of IDIR login page.

With the disabling of SSO, the UMS Authentication Method for the new user was required to be LDAP. Since there is no option available at the time of the account creation step to change the UMS Authentication Method, a resource from the System Security team was required to go into the newly created account and manually change the UMS Authentication Method field to LDAP. This proved to be an unnecessary consumption of available resources.

To save available resource time that was being consumed unnecessarily by going in to the account and manually changing the field, it was requested by System Security team to set the default UMS Authentication Method to LDAP at the time of a new account creation or existing account update.",,andrew.lee,chaminda.jayasekara,david.robbins,jason.kelly,shelvin.chandra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21/Aug/19 2:18 PM;chaminda.jayasekara;image-20190821-211816.png;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10800/image-20190821-211816.png,23/Aug/19 11:53 AM;shelvin.chandra;image-20190823-185233.png;https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10810/image-20190823-185233.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,chaminda.jayasekara,,S055,,,,,, ,{},,,,,,, ,, TST-480972,, ,, ,,,,, ,,RLS-473773,,,,nilesh.maha,1|i00bwn:,,,,,shelvin.chandra,,,,https://bcldbit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WL/pages/998146208/S055+-+IAM+import+to+TECSYS+using+incorrect+authentication+type,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-06-12 04:05:30.35,"11/Jun/19 9:05 PM;jason.kelly;hi [~chaminda.jayasekara]

Hi James and Bikram,



Do you think we can assign this task to Shelvin?



Sri will be able to guide Shelvin on this small dev work, and I believe it is a good learning/knowledge transfer on OSB to Shelvin.

Master Packing List - Discrepancy between two case count tables (S058),DDCFUN-836,12533,Story,In-Development,DDCFUN,DDC Stabilization 2019,software,brad.rykenhuizen,,,Medium,,craig.kelly,lauren.mackenzie,lauren.mackenzie,03/May/19 1:28 PM,15/Aug/19 2:43 PM,25/Jul/19 5:30 PM,,,0,Outbound,,"Relating to MSM #436111.

*Issue: *
There is a discrepancy between the two tables summarizing case count on the Master Packing list.  The first table, showing the case count by customer order # (EBS).  In the first case count, 
* TECSYS calculations count the cases in each Oracle order
* Then “floor” (cut off any decimals) from the total.  
* So, if there were three half cases (0.5), the calculation would sum to 1.5, and then floor, so it would become 1.

The second table, summarizes the case count by container #.  In the second case count, 
* TECSYS calculations first floor the decimals from the total cases in each container
* Then also floor the total.
* So if there were three half cases (0.5), the first floor would turn them into 0s, then it would sum to 0 (and then floor again).

*Requirements:*
1.  In the first table, summarizing the case count by Oracle Order #
a.  Add a column showing number of bottles per order #
b.  Provide a total for the # of bottles at the bottom of the table

2.  In the second table, summarizing the case count by Container #
a. Add a column showing number of bottles per order #

Pick by Order CPREs put all remaining picks for the order (cases and bottles) into a Container CPRE (RPAL).  Because the bottle picks are not on a bottle pick CPRE, the Container Packing list and Master Packing list treat the bottle picks as a fraction of a case pick. Then, the tables are flooring (cutting off) the decimals.

So there’s two related items to resolve this: 

1.	There’s already a JIRA ticket for the flooring of bottle picks (JIRA DDCFUN-459) on the documents, and the request from John was to add a bottle pick column on the master packing list – alleviating the discrepancy between the first and second tables on the Master Packing List, and ensuring the bottle picks are counted correctly.

2.	For the Container Packing list, Bikram is able to add in the logic that for Pick by Order CPREs, the Container Packing list logic will show the bottle pick amounts even when the bottle pick was on a Pick by Order CPRE (Container CPRE).

Please note that, the bottle picks are picked, and included in the shipment, so the customer is being invoiced for them even though they are not showing on the Container Packing list.

As a result, the system is slowing down and most recently it came to a holt.

Following business stakeholders need to consult before making the final configuration:

*  Distribution - Liquor 
*  Wholesale Supply Chain - Liquor 
*  Wholesale Pricing and Imports
*  Finance - Wholesale 
*  Corporate Loss Prevention  (CLP) ??
*  IT Security Compliance
*  IT Business Analytics and Data Services 



*Data Archiving*: Process of migrating data from a ‘source’ system into a long-term storage location. Archived data is no longer available online from the source system, however, if required; it can be retrieved on a case-by-case basis.

*Data Retention*: Identifies the duration of time for which the data should be maintained or ""retained"" in the system. During this time, the data can be accessed normally without any special method or tool.

*Archived Data Retention Period*: Identifies the duration of time for which the archived data should be maintained in the long-term storage location. After this time, the data is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered in any way.

*Transaction Level data:* Identifies as much information as possible as recorded by the source system. This should include information such as, who, what, where and when. For example SKU 18 for 100CS were received by Receiver 1 and Putaway by Putaway user 1 to the location XXX.  The cycle count was performed by Inventory Management user 1 and adjusted + or - quantity X at the location XXX on date and time.

1-  The Following menu item was updated to LDB Receipt Closeout ( earlier- Receipt Closeout)
                          Warehouse Management->Mobile WMS-->LDB Receipt Closeout.
2. The View has a  header name as LDB Receipt Closeout instead of Receipt Closeout.
3. The presence of Action button above the top row has 'Close Out' option.
4. The presence of Action button on the left side of the row has 'Close Out' option.

Based on the requirements stated above in the Description section, this ticket is good from SIT.

The operations leadership team has received number of ideas from Putaway team members on enhancing the Putaway process. 

BP1. After selecting the Store menu in the handheld, the user is required to click on the “Tag or Container” field before scanning the tag number. This requires one click to enable the focus to the field before the scan.

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

PB2. After tag is scanned, user is required to click “Confirm Drop-off” before scanning the drop off location. This requires one click to enable the focus to the field before the scan. There are additional field in the screen can be removed as those not been used by the LDB.

 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail!  !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! 

BP3. After the drop off location confirmed, the system does not automatically go back to Store menu to start the next scan.  To go back to Store menu to start the next scan, it requires few scans. 

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

*Stakeholders:*

* John Sweet is the primary requester
* All DC employees assigned to Putaway function. 


*Business Requirement:*

BP1 - No work is required. The problem was solved by recent updates to the handheld software ( APK update)


BP2 – Move following fields to tab 2 ( similar to receiving screen) “Confirm Product”, “To Container”, “To-Container Type”


BP2 – Auto enable “Confirm drop-off” scanning field


BP3 – No work is required. The problem was solved by recent updates to the handheld software ( APK update)


*Business impact / rationale:*

All DC employees assigned to Putaway function/task. 

Severity of issue: Medium

Frequency of occurrence: Every time Putaway function/task is required.

Complexity to resolve: Easy win


*Potential Options to Resolve (with preferred option):*

Create two tabs for Putaway screen.


Move not frequently used fields to tab 2.
